 Hey,I'm gonna make you master in C programming language.
First of all,
~What is C ?
~History of C.
~Why C?

Lets get started with our first question
*What is C?
C is a structured,procedural programming language which is 
widely used in both operating systems and applications.
It is a middle level language.
*History of C 
Dennis Ritchie is known as father of C Programming ,
He developed this is bell laboratories in 1972.
It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix
operating system.
During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity
*Why C?
c is worth learning in this modern era of cmputers
It gives you the basic idea of programming languages 
It is simple and easy
C is faster as compared to any other languages.

Now coming to the basic structure of a C program
/*comment section/title*/
pre processors or header file inclusion
main()
{
	declaration section;
	stmt 1;
	stmt 2;
	stmt 3;
	.
	.stmt n;
}
/*program to print a simple message*/
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	printf("This is my first C program");
	return 0;
}

congratulations we've done with out first C program.
like this more programs are there
 lesse some other examples
